# Phase 1: Error Handling & Reliability Implementation Plan

## Section 9: Additional improvements identified

### 9.1 Inefficient JSON handling:
- Current code uses `json.dumps()` on already-parsed JSON objects
- Remove unnecessary `json.dumps()` calls and `.replace('"','')` operations
- Direct access to values is more efficient and cleaner

### 9.2 Missing rain station API error handling:
- Plan should include error handling for rain station API calls in `set_gauges()`
- Rain measurement parsing needs same error handling as river measurements
